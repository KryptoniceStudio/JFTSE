## Introduction

**JFTSE** is an open source project for the game **Fantasy Tennis**.    

It's a server emulator and written in Java.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.


## Requirements

Since it's cross-platform I will not provide download links otherwise I will bloat this. If you use Windows then download them for Windows. If for Linux then download them for Linux.

| Name | Version |
|------|---------|
| JDK / OpenJDK | 15 / 15 |
| Maven | â‰¥ 3.6.3 |
| MySQL | 8.0 |
| Any Java capable IDE [^1] | Any Version |
| Fantasy Tennis Thai | 1.706 |

* Also you need a Git CLI or GUI. Doesn't matter which one.

**_Note:_** If under Windows, Maven & JDK has to be configured in your PATH variable. 

## Project structure

The project is divided into 11 modules:

----------------
* **emulator** - Old emulator, will be removed in the future
* **entities** - Database model, repository and converters
* **commons** - Utility classes
* **commons-proto** - Protocol buffer classes
* **server-core** - The core of the server containing abstract networking classes, protocol, codec, service classes for DB access, shared enums and constants needed by server implementations
* **b2b-webservice** - RESTful web service for the B2B API
* **auth-server** - Login server implementation
* **game-server** - Game server implementation (lobby, singleplay, matchplay, etc.)
* **chat-server** - Chat server implementation (chat lobby & rooms)
* **relay-server** - Relay server implementation (match interaction between players has to be broadcast to all players in the match)
* **ac-server** - Anti-cheat server implementation (JFTSE only)

## Installation

### Building the server itself

#### Getting the source code

```
git clone -b master git://github.com/sstokic-tgm/JFTSE.git
```
This will clone master branch, this is the  **RECOMMENDED**  branch for starters.

### Compiling the source code

#### Building the core

```
cd <path to the recently cloned project>
mvn clean install
```
This will compile and build the core.

#### Keeping the code up to date

To update the core files, do the following:
```
cd <path to the cloned project>
# For master branch
git pull origin master
```
Afterwards you can build the emulator:
```
mvn clean install
```

## Running the emulator

### Running it the first time

Before you run it the first time, please execute[^2] the SQL file **_create_fantasytennis.sql_** located inside **emulator/sql/create/**.

Build the emulator and run it via:
```
cd auth-server/target
java -jar auth-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
Or you run it from inside your Java IDE if using one.

The auth-server will do his first time initialization and the process will take some time. It loades static data like products of the shop etc.    
When it says 
> **auth-server successfully started!**

Then the initialization was successful and the auth-server is running.

Before you start to play, you have to do 3 more things:
1. Execute[^2] the SQL file **__gameservertype.sql__** located inside **emulator/sql/insert/** (execute this first!)
2. Execute[^2] the SQL file **__gameserver.sql__** located inside **emulator/sql/insert/**
3. Create a new account inside the Account table

Then you can start other server implementations you need or want to play on:
```
cd game-server/target
java -jar game-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The relay-server is needed for playing since it relays/broadcasts the match interaction between players to all players in the match:
```
cd relay-server/target
java -jar relay-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Running it

You run the emulators via:
```
cd xxx-server/target
java -jar xxx-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Running client
1. Download FT Client from : https://www.jftse.com/client/FantaTennis.7z
2. Unzip and execute it for the first time in order to create configuration files
3. Edit 'Serverinfo.ini' file to replace the IP (127.0.0.1) and Port (5894)
4. Start the client with 'FantaTennis.exe' and log in with the created account

[^1]: If you want to develop yourself.
[^2]: You do it inside MySQL. Via CLI or some GUI application, it doesn't matter.
